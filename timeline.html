                    <p>Description: Taken on 2021/12/21, this is a multiply-imaged supernova in a distant galaxy designated MRG-M0138. In the image, two instances of the supernova are circled.


                Significance:
                1. The image captures a rare phenomenon of gravitational lensing
                2. This marks the first time two gravitationally lensed supernovae have been found in the same galaxy, offering insights into the dynamics of distant celestial objects.
               
                Background knowledge:
                1. Supernova:
                        Powerful and luminous stellar explosion that occurs during the final stages of a massive star's life. They play a key role in dispersing heavy elements, enriching the interstellar medium and providing the building blocks for new stars, planets, and life.
                2. Gravitational Lensing:
                        A phenomenon where massive objects like galaxy clusters can bend and distort light from more distant objects behind them, producing multiple distorted images of the same background object.</p>

                    <p>This landscape of “mountains” and “valleys” speckled with glittering stars is actually the edge of a nearby, young, star-forming region called NGC 3324 in the Carina Nebula. It reveals for the first time previously invisible areas of star birth.
                       <br>
                        Background knowledge: NGC 3324 is a young star-forming region located within the Carina Nebula, a vast stellar nursery in the southern sky. It's known for its active star formation. The Hubble Space Telescope observed a western section of NGC 3324 in detail, and the same section was one of the first observations of the James Webb Space Telescope
                        <br>
                        Significance: As one of the very first images released by the James Webb Telescope, the image unveils previously invisible areas of star birth within NGC 3324, providing insights into how stars form within cosmic dust and gas clouds.

            Background knowledge: The Sagittarius C (Sgr C) Region is situated approximately 300 light-years away from the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.
            It contains a cluster of young stars surrounded by dusty clouds and ionized hydrogen gas.
           
            Time: November 20, 2023
           
            Significance: The image demonstrates the intricate structures and processes involved in the birth of stars, providing insights into the formation of massive stars in extreme galactic environments.</p>

                        Time: November 28, 2023
                       
                        Background Knowledge: Herbig-Haro (HH) objects are bright regions surrounding newborn stars, formed when the outflows from these young stars collide with surrounding gas and dust at high velocities. Studying them provides insights into the early stages of star formation and the interaction between young stars and their environments
                       
                        Significance: Astronomers used to think the “string” is only one star, but this image unveils that there are 2. In addition, by studying the interactions between young stars and their surrounding environments, astronomers can gain insights into the processes driving star formation.">

                         The image shows Arp 107, a pair of interacting galaxies, observed through Webb's NIRCam (Near Infrared Camera). The larger galaxy displays a hazy, bright white center surrounded by a ring of gaseous filaments in varying shades of white and pink. The smaller galaxy to the left exhibits hazy white gas and dust, becoming more diffuse towards its outer regions.
               
                       
                        Background Knowledge: Arp 107 refers to a pair of galaxies that are gravitationally interacting with each other, leading to unique and often visually striking features. Interacting galaxies can exhibit tidal tails, bridges, distortions, and other features due to their gravitational influence on each other.
                       
                       
                        Significance of the Photo: Galactic Interactions: It showcases the effects of gravitational forces on interacting galaxies, providing astronomers with valuable data to study galaxy evolution, star formation, and the impact of interactions on cosmic structures.
